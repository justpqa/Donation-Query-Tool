# Donation-Query-Tool
Something I decided to make on a weekend last year or 2 to help people in Vietnam look up for their donation info. The dashboard contains around 14000 pages of carefully parsed donation information to help people easily search for it. Created with Python, PyMuPDF, Pandas, and Looker Studio.
